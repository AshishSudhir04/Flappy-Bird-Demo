# 🐦 Flappy Bird Demo (Python + Pygame)

A simple Flappy Bird clone created using Python's `pygame` library. This project demonstrates basic game development concepts such as event handling, collision detection, gravity, and surface interaction.

## 🎮 Features

- Player-controlled bird that flaps on spacebar press
- Scrolling pipes as obstacles
- Gravity and bird movement physics
- Collision detection between bird and pipes/floor
- Timer-based pipe generation using custom Pygame events
- Infinite scrolling floor
- Clean code structure for easy understanding and modification

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

This project is great for:

- Understanding how game loops work
- Working with `pygame` surfaces and rects
- Handling timed events using `pygame.time.set_timer`
- Detecting collisions using `colliderect`
- Managing object movement and gravity
